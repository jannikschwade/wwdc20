## Scope

This playground was created for the *WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge* of Apple, where you can showcase your love to code, specificly in the programming language Swift. This year the topic was free of choise but the task was to 
> create an interactive scene in a Swift playground that can be experienced within three minutes.

## Idea

My playground is designed to tell a personal story about handling red-green color blindness. The idea came when I talked to a friend of mine about one of my designs, where she said the colors were a little odd. As I explained her why that’s the cause I came up with the idea to show developers what it means to be color blind and give them tips on how to improve their designs and apps. It’s not difficult to keep some design basics in mind – when you know about the problem and its possible solutions. That’s where I want to support with my playground.

## Technology

During my research on how to approach my ideas, I stumbled across a lot of resources to SpriteKit, so I ended up checking it out. I've ended up using SpriteKit for nearly my whole playground. Since I’m always been a lover of simple 2D games that also meant, that I might be able to program my own one when knowing the basics. Then there are also some little elements written with UIKit, like the image comparison where I compare normal vision with red-green blindness vision.
